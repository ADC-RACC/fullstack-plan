## Hello

I made this simple full stack repo to pass a test. Because I found there was something critical I was missing when making them. So I decided to go step by step and nail full-stack.
It uses React, Javascript, and a tad bit of CSCC, and HTML.
In the future I could make this look better and make a reason for this to continue to exist.
